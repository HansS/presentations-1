Wine
----

.. class:: handout

    Wine is a recursive acronym that stands for Wine is Not an Emulator. Wine
    is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X, OpenGL,
    and Unix.

        “Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs.
        Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free
        alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100%
        non-Microsoft code.”

        — http://winehq.org

    Even the fastest emulators are slow and must 'fake' running emulated
    programs natively. Wine natively runs Windows programs at native speeds.
    Also, it should be noted that speed is currently not a goal for the Wine
    project.

    Wine Is Not an Emulator

        “Windows applications that do not make system calls will run just as
        fast as on Windows.”

So What is Wine?
----------------

.. class:: handout

        “Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source
        code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified
        Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes.”

A Not-So-Short History
----------------------

.. class:: handout

    In 1992 Sun Microsystems aquired a company with a product that allowed
    users of Solaris x86 and Solaris 2.2 for SPARC to run Windows applications
    out of the box. Wabi was unique in that it allowed Windows windowing calls
    to be translated directly to X Windows calls.

    At the time, the chances of Wabi being ported to Linux were slim to none.
    So in 1993 a mailing list was formed to discuss a similar project for
    Linux. Several of the early developers included some of the first Linux
    kernel hackers.

    In 1994 Microsoft began releasing 32-bit code and adding new functionality
    to their operating systems. It was no longer enough to just load code and
    run it, a more sophisticated integration was needed with the underlying
    operating systems (primarily Linux.) Mechanisms needed to be added that
    supported network connections and registry files.

    Doug Ridgway set up the WineHQ web site in 1997. The site was taken over by
    Corel for a few years, and then CodeWeavers took it over from them in
    March, 2002.

    In 1998 a strategic decision was made by Corel to wholeheartedly support
    Linux. Corel’s suite of office programs demanded a high level of Wine
    sophistication. For the first time Wine was being supported by commercial
    development. CodeWeavers was contracted by Corel to improve parts of Wine
    in 1999.

    Early 2001 Corel spun off its Linux division and CodeWeavers began
    developing their own products and putting a lot of polish on Wine. Their
    own version of Wine included graphical management tools and an easy setup.
    Their first product, CrossOver Plugin, allowed Linux users to run Netscape
    plugins designed for Windows. Newer versions of the product have added
    support for even more plugins. They released CrossOver Office in March,
    2002 to provide support for office applications like Excel and Lotus Notes. 

    TransGaming formed in August of 2001. Gavriel State, who had been with
    Corel, left and formed his own company. Limited DirectX support had been in
    Wine since 1997 and Gavriel sought to make it more robust. WineX 1.0 was
    released in October of 2001 with support for six games. Some of the early
    TransGaming work also sought to include support for copy protection
    measures.

    The Linux distribution Lindows also formed in 2001. It’s goal was to create
    a simple to use Linux desktop and to let users run Windows programs. They
    quickly abandoned the idea in favor of native applications, but before that
    happened they sponsored Wineconf - a three day event in March, 2002 that
    brought together developers from around the world.

    Licensing debates plagued the project for several years. In the beginning
    it was under a BSD-style license, but in 1999 Richard Stallman pointed out
    that was incompatible with the GPL which potentially causes problems with
    any open source project wishing to use Wine code. A vote was called for and
    in January of 2000 the project switched to the X11 license. In March of
    2002 a poll was conducted among both the free and commercial developers of
    Wine—there was concern that the code may be appropriated by a commercial
    entity—so they chose the Lesser General Public License since that meant
    changes to Wine required that you release the source code with your changes
    but simply linking with Wine does not require you to release the source to
    your application. Wine development picked up speed after this change.

    Another developer’s conference was held in January, 2004 in St. Paul
    Minnesota sponsored by CodeWeavers.

    Microsoft has not made public statements about Wine. However, the Microsoft
    Update software will block updates to Microsoft application software
    running in Wine-based environments. On February 16, 2005, Ivan Leo Puoti
    discovered that Microsoft had started checking the Windows registry for the
    Wine configuration key and would block the Windows Update for any
    component. The Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) system also checks for
    existence of Wine registry keys.

Versions
--------

.. class:: handout

    CodeWeavers employs the lead Wine developer, Alexandre Julliard, and has a
    long history of contributing back to the project.

    CrossOver (formerly CrossOver Office) now has Linux and Mac (x86) versions,
    and recently launched a Gaming version which has a faster release cycle and
    less emphasis on stability. CrossOver has Standard and Professional
    versions. The professional version provides enhanced deployability and
    manageability features for corporate users. The Standard version allows a
    single user of a single machine. The Professional version allows multiple
    users.

    Transgaming focuses on gaming. Cedega (formerly WineX) is a fork of the
    last X11-licensed version of Wine and is proprietary. Transgaming has a bad
    reputation for not contributing back to the Wine project, although they
    initially promised to contribute their DirectX improvements. Cedega
    includes licensed support for several types of CD-based copy protection.

        “TransGaming currently gives back very little code to Wine. Cedega is
        not ‘Wine with more gaming support’ — because Wine has had years of
        development since Cedega was made, many games actually run better under
        Wine than under Cedega. Currently, Wine has more advanced Direct3D
        support than Cedega, but Cedega still has more advanced copy protection
        support due tTransGaming’s licensing of (closed source) code from a
        handful of copy protection companies. Unlike CrossOver, most
        improvements to Wine don’t get into Cedega due to the license
        differences between Cedega and Wine.”

How to Get Started
------------------

``wine ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/notepad.exe``

``wine "C:\windows\notepad.exe"``

A Note about ``WINEPREFIX``
---------------------------

.. class:: handout

    (CrossOver has a similar convention called “bottles”.) This allows you to
    segregate Windows programs from one another that require different
    configurations or need to be kept in isolation so as not to threaten other
    Windows programs. Note that this does make other prefixed directories
    invisible to one another.

    Previous to Wine 1.0 you had to run ``wineprefixcreate``, now it handles it
    automatically.

``WINEPREFIX=$HOME/games/warcraftiii wine notepad.exe``

Configuration
-------------

.. class:: handout

    It is sometimes necessary to create fake DLL files to trick many programs
    that check for file existence to determine whether a particular feature
    (such as Winsock and its TCP/IP networking) is available.

    In case Wine complains about a missing DLL, you should check whether this
    file is a publicly available DLL or a custom DLL belonging to your program
    (by searching for its name on the internet).

    You can copy your .ttf fonts into the ``c:\windows\fonts`` directory.

.. class:: incremental

    * ``winecfg``
    * ``regedit``

      * ``system.reg`` contains ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``
      * ``user.reg`` contains ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``
      * ``userdef.reg`` contains ``HKEY_USERS\.Default``

Running Wine
------------

.. class:: handout

    Wine will pass on your shell environment to the Windows program which is
    useful if you want to set any environment variables. The exceptions to this
    are the ``PATH``, ``SYSTEM``, and ``TEMP`` variables.

    * ``uninstaller``
    * ``wine eject``
    * ``wineboot``
    * ``wine control``
    * ``wineconsole``
    * ``winefile``
    * ``WINEDEBUG=-all``
    * ``AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp2`` for OSS
