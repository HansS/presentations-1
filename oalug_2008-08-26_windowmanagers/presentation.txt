.. footer:: Window Managers


So What’s a Window Manager?
---------------------------

.. class:: handout

    An X window manager does not directly interact with video hardware, mice,
    or keyboards—that is the job of a Windowing System.

    A basic window manager handles re-parenting (window decorations, or flash),
    and window tiling and stacking (& mouse movement interactions).

* Parenting (window decorations)
* Window tiling / stacking


But there’s a lot of gray area
------------------------------

.. class:: handout

    The line between a window manager and desktop environment is not always
    clear. A desktop environment usually consists of a window manager as well
    as a file manager.

* Customizable appearance
* Textual menus
* Docks, program launchers
* Multiple desktops & pagers / virtual desktops
* Compiz


Fluxbox
-------

.. class:: handout

    Very popular. Xcompmgr can add transparency effects. Enhancements can also
    be provided by using iDesk or fbdesk, or the ROX Desktop. The slit.

    Set background with xsetroot or esetroot, etc.

.. class:: incremental

    * Based on Blackbox
    * Ultralightweight
    * UI has a taskbar and a menu
    * Window decoration has tabs
    * Configured with text files

Openbox
-------

.. class:: handout

    ObConf. Highly configurable. All mouse and keyboard bindings can be
    configured. For example, if a user wants a window to go to desktop 3 when
    the close button is clicked with the middle mouse button, the user can do
    this trivially.

    Openbox’s menu system has a method for using dynamic menus. This is done by
    accepting the output of a script and using that output as the source for a
    menu.

    Each time the user points his or her mouse at the sub-menu, the script is
    re-run and the menu is regenerated. For instance, two developers wrote a
    script in Python that lists a user’s new Gmail messages in a sub-menu.

    How do I put my desktops into a grid layout instead of a single row?

    Your pager is responsible for doing this, and communicates with Openbox to
    make sure they agree on it. Any pager which complies with the EWMH
    specification should be able to do this. Examples are the gnome-panel pager
    and rox-pager.

.. class:: incremental

    * Originally based on Blackbox

      * Later completely rewritten in C

    * Configured with ~/.config/openbox/{menu.xml,rc.xml}
    * Highly configurable
    * Dynamic menus

IceWM
-----

.. class:: handout

    Comes with themes that allow it to imitate the UI of Windows 95, OS/2,
    Motif, and others.

    A well-known user of IceWM as their default desktop is the Easy mode of the
    Asus Eee PC.

.. class:: incremental

    * Configured with text files
    * Optional, built-in taskbar with menu, tasks display, network and CPU
      meters, mail check and configurable clock
    * Native support for GNOME and KDE menus

fvwm
----

.. class:: handout

    The F Virtual Window Manager. The F currently has no meaning, but it was
    originally for Feeble.

    Robert Nation (of rxvt fame) began hacking twm to find out why it used so
    much memory, and to add support for virtual desktops.

    Many of the popular window managers in use today are related to FVWM:
    Afterstep, Xfce, Enlightenment, Metisse and others.

.. class:: incremental

    * Originally derived from twm in 1993
    * Lightweight & feature-full
    * Native Mouse Gestures
    * Dynamic menus; utilities to browse the filesystem, fetch headlines from
      the internet from menus included.
