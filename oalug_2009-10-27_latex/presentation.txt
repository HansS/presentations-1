Pronunciation
=============

    "The characters T, E, X in the name come from capital Greek letters tau,
    epsilon, and chi, as the name of TeX derives from the Greek [word for]
    skill, art, technique..."

    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Pronouncing_and_writing_.22LaTeX.22


Implementations & Versions
==========================

Of which there are *many*.

TeX
===

Written in 1978. One of the most sophisticated digital typographical
systems in the world.

"to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonable amount
of effort, and to provide a system that would give the exact same results
on all computers, now and in the future."

Version 3 was released in 1989. The current version of TeX is 3.1415926.
The design was frozen after version 3.0, and no new feature or fundamental
change will be added, so all newer versions will contain only bug fixes.

Knuth firmly believes that having an unchanged system that will produce the
same output now and in the future is more important than introducing new
features. For this reason, he has stated that the "absolutely final change
(to be made after my death)" will be to change the version number to pi, at
which point all remaining bugs will become features

Other Engines
=============

XeTeX
    "zee-TeX". TeX engine using Unicode and modern font tech such as OpenType.

pdfTeX
    Features "protruding, which generalizes the concept of hanging punctuation,
    and font expansion".

    Included in most distributions of LaTeX and ConTeXt.

    Can output directly to PDF instead of DVI.

LuaTeX
    Started as pdfTeX with a Lua engine embedded. The successor to pdfTeX.


Abstractions
============

LaTeX
    Easy to use interface to the TeX engine.

    "Authors should be able to focus on the content of what they are writing
    without being distracted by its visual presentation."

ConTeXt
    "Text with TeX."

    "providing structured interfaces for handling typography, including
    extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations,
    figure-text integration, and conditional compilation"

xelatex
    The XeTeX LaTeX counterpart.


Distributions
=============

TeX Live
    A "comprehensive TeX system for most types of Unix, including GNU/Linux and
    Mac OS X, and also Windows." A replacement for teTeX (deprecated).

MacTeX
    A redistribution of TeX Live with Mac-specific utilities and frontends.



Basics
======

* .tex
* .cls
* .sty

.cls
====

“Classes”::

    \documentclass{}

* Mandatory
* One per document
* Ideally, completely define document structure 

  * E.g., ``article`` class defines ``\section``, ``\tableofcontents``,
    ``\author``, and so on.

.sty
====

“Style files” or “packages”::

    \usepackage{}

* Optional
* Can appear many times
* Ideally, amendments to a .cls file or additional functionality

  * E.g., ``graphicx`` provides methods to include images and apply graphic
    effects to a document.
